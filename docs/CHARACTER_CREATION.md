# Character Creation Workflow  
*Based on the 2024 Edition (One D&D) Rules Preview*

This guide outlines the step-by-step flow for building a Level 1 character using the updated structure from the 2024 revision to Dungeons & Dragons. The design follows the philosophy of "play before details" and puts emphasis on Origins, flexible ability scores, and fast customization.

---

## Overview

- Characters begin at **Level 1**
- Class and Origin define most of the mechanical identity
- Ability scores can be assigned flexibly regardless of Species or Background
- This process assumes a digital or guided tool, not pen-and-paper character sheets

---

## Step 1: Choose a Class

Pick a **Class** that defines your character’s core mechanics, role in the party, and initial abilities.

**Examples:**
- **Barbarian** – Rage, durability, front-line combat
- **Wizard** – Versatile spellcasting, arcane utility
- **Cleric** – Divine magic, healing, and channel divinity
- **Fighter** – Weapon mastery and extra attacks
- **Rogue** – Sneaky, skill-focused, sneak attack

> Subclasses are chosen at later levels (usually Level 3) and are not selected during initial character creation.

---

## Step 2: Choose a Background

Backgrounds provide narrative flavor and mechanical benefits. They include skill proficiencies, a 1st-level feat, and a language or tool.

**Examples:**
- **Acolyte** – Religious training and insight
- **Soldier** – Combat training and discipline
- **Charlatan** – Deception, forgery, and disguise
- **Sage** – Academic knowledge and research
- **Folk Hero** – Defender of the common people

---

## Step 3: Choose a Species

Species define biological and cultural traits. Each species comes with a set of inherent features like movement speed, size, senses, and resistances.

**Examples:**
- **Human** – Versatile and adaptable
- **Elf** – Keen senses, fey ancestry, trance
- **Dwarf** – Hardy, stonecunning, poison resistance
- **Dragonborn** – Breath weapon and elemental resistance
- **Tiefling** – Infernal legacy, resistance to fire
- **Orc** – Powerful build, aggressive instincts

---

## Step 4: Assign Ability Scores

Choose how to assign your six core ability scores:  
**Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma**

### Available Methods:
- **Standard Array**: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8
- **Point Buy**: 27 points to allocate across stats (e.g., a more custom distribution)
- **Random Roll**: Roll 4d6, drop the lowest, repeat six times
- **Class Default**: Pre-made stat layouts ideal for your class
- **Manual Entry**: Input your own values (e.g., rolled offline)

> In the 2024 edition, Species no longer grant fixed ability score bonuses.

---

## Step 5: Choose an Alignment

Optional step that can inform roleplay or interaction with certain spells/magic items.

**Alignment options:**
- **Lawful Good**
- **Neutral Good**
- **Chaotic Good**
- **Lawful Neutral**
- **True Neutral**
- **Chaotic Neutral**
- **Lawful Evil**
- **Neutral Evil**
- **Chaotic Evil**

Some tables ignore alignment altogether or use **Ideals, Bonds, and Flaws** instead.

---

## Step 6: Describe Your Character

This is where you give your character personality and visual flavor.

### Name
- Enter your own

### Appearance & Personality
Choose, roll, or invent:
- **Physical traits**: height, build, skin, eyes, hair
- **Personality traits**: quirks, motivations, fears
- **Ideals**: guiding beliefs (e.g., justice, chaos, freedom)
- **Bonds**: personal connections or duties
- **Flaws**: weaknesses or habits

> Optionally, you may allow the system to generate a personality sketch based on your scores, alignment, and class.

---

## Summary

After completing these steps, your character has:
- A chosen **Class** with mechanical identity
- A fully defined **Origin** (Species + Background + Languages)
- Assigned **Ability Scores**
- An optional **Alignment**
- A **Name**, appearance, and personality profile

Your character is now ready to enter the world. Next steps like equipment, spells, and backstory expansion can follow depending on the needs of the campaign.

- Subclass selection and Level 3+ support
- Spell and inventory management
- Starting gear choices based on class and background
- Random name generator, with optional tags
- Feat selection beyond level 1
- Homebrew content editor (classes, feats, backgrounds, etc.)
- Export to printable format or VTT JSON (e.g., Foundry, Roll20)
